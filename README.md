This is just all the random web apps I've worked on while not having much to do.

All webapps must be in parallel folders for the links to work.

Main file is the lang.html file. This file links to the snake.html file via one of the buttons on the page, and hosts the doge.html file as an inline-frame. Note: One of
the buttons links to arvin.moe, which I am not associated with.

snake.html is actually a somewhat serious attempt at recreating snake from scratch on a platform I am unfamiliar with.

doge.html is an earlier attempt at working with html, javascript, and CSS. Slight edits to the javascript, namely replacing the local source image files with imgur
links, made by Arvin Ziaei: (the owner of arvin.moe).
