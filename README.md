This is just all the random web apps I've worked on while not having much to do.

The lang and snake webapps must be in parallel folders for the link to work.

Main file is the lang.html file. This file links to the snake.html file via one of the buttons on the page. Note: One of the buttons links to arvin.moe, 
which I am not associated with.

snake.html is actually a somewhat serious attempt at recreating snake from scratch on a platform I am unfamiliar with.
